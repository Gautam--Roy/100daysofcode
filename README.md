# 100 Days of Code Challenge: Python Edition

Yo!! Welcome to the 100 Days of Code Challenge: Python Edition, where i'll commit all my progress throughout the course.
I'm following "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023 by Dr. Angela Yu" on Udemy.


# Update :
I don't think i'll be able to follow along every day as i've got better shit to do now. But i'll make sure i finish the course just for the heck of it.
